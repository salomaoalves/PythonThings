I separated this repository in many folders (ANN & Deep Learning, BioPython, DataAnalysis, MachineLearning, Python, Statistic and Text Mining). Each folder has some .py file about something related to Python, here I describe about each folder, saying what is in each one.

**1 - ANN & Deep Leaning**

**2 - BioPython**

**3 - Data Analysis**

**4 - Machine Learning**

**5 - Python**

**6 - Statistic**

**7 - Text Mining**
